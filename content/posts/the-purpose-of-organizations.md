The only rational purpose of an organization is to improve the lives
of its members.

We work together---we organize---when we are all better off for it.
In business organizations this comes in the form of earning more money
together than we could on our own and distributing it to the members
of the organization. Only a few of the members of the traditional
business organization earn the exponential returns that successful
businesses generate while a majority of the members earn a linear
salary. Given most peoples situations, risk tolerance, histories,
etc. a job that pays the bills with enough left over to save for
retirement is the best balance of all factors. Working a job for a
traditional company makes their life better than the alternatives.

The only rational purpose of an organization is to improve the lives
of its members.

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) could change that story.
When the benefits offered by centralized leadership can be provided by
cryptoeconomic mechanisms DAOs will offer people those benefits
without the cost of that centralized leadership---without the cost of
most of the exponential returns going to a board of directors and a C
suite. When DAOs can coordinate vision and direction, decisive
decision making, and division of responsibilities as well as
traditional organizations do now they'll be in a position to make
members lives better than the traditional organization can because
they'll be able to offer the exponential returns that would otherwise
go to the leadership of traditional organizations.

The only rational purpose of an organization is to improve the lives
of its members.
