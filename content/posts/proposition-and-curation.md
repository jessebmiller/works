My drawings each take [less than a minute to
do](https://www.instagram.com/p/BtWjDSHh0pG/). Most of them are
average or not very good---as you statisticians are noting. I've done
more of these than I can count and a bunch are pretty good---like the
one I liked enough to cut out an paste onto that beautiful piece of
veneer. Twice in my life have they turned out excellent. Here is the
most recent, and I think the better of the two.

There is a human soul in a particular state of mind staring out of
that 45 second scribble.

I didn't gain the ability to do that from practice. I cannot replicate
that drawing. It came with
[luck and a lot of attempts](https://youtu.be/XzYLHOX50Bc?t=33). Systems
that produce lots of attempts with the right amount of variability and
curate the output can produce excellence. When future attempts benefit
from past success they are engines for progress. It's how learning
works and it's how economies work. Unfortunately I don't learn
anything applicable to future drawings from my successes. I finish
them and am dumbly curious why they turned out this way and others
another way. If I want more excellent drawings I have to make more bad
ones in proportion and select the ones I like. I have a few strategies
available to me to increase my output of excellent drawings. I can
spend more time making attempts, I can vary my technique (size of pen,
different mediums, size of paper, etc.)  looking for methods that
produce a higher density of excellent drawings, or I can find and
remove the wasted time in my process. Systems that can learn from past
attempts will improve proportionally to both the number of attempts
they make and the amount they learn from those attempts.

## The Scientific Method

*The scientific method is an engine for progress.*

* Lots of attempts: Science is a community open to anyone. Success in
  science offers prestige and in some cases good money. There are
  strong incentives to participate.
* Curation: It has a (roughly) verifiable protocol which includes peer
  review and lessons learned from the past (benefits of blinded
  studies for instance)
* Produces information that selectively and productively reduces
  variability of future attempts

## The Toyota Product Development System

*Toyota's process is an engine for progress.*

* Lots of attempts: Set Based Design Respect for people. Get ideas
  from everyone. Reduce the cost of attempts through "command intent"
  rather than "command and control". Push authority to make attempts
  as low as possible down the organization structure---where most of
  the people and experience are. More people empowered to make
  attempts increases the number of attempts made. It also increases
  the variety of attempts because it comes from a pool with a variety
  of expertise and experiences.


* Toyota's process pushes responsibility for ideas and decisions as
  low as they can (while still remaining a company)

## Squad Games

*Squad Games is an engine for progress.* This is the project I've been
working on nights and weekends for the last two years with Ezra Weller
and we've been
[streaming development live on twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/setmatchgames)
Saturdays for about that long.
