Emblem Studio is an product development DAO with a continuous funding
mechanism that autonomously controls organization growth, selects good
managers, and encourages active participation in governance.

The mechanism consists of a bonding curve---whose tokens are taxed via
Common Ownership Self-assessed Tax (COST)---with only two ways for new
tokens to be minted. One is an initial supply of tokens minted upon
contract creation and the other is that the COST is used by the system
to mint more. Tokens can be sold back to the bonding curve as usual
and grant governance rights. All available tokens (either newly minted
or those with unpaid taxes) are auctioned and the proceeds of those
auctions go to funding the project.

It selects managers that are more able to increase the value of the
network, because the governance rights are more valuable to those who
can increase the value of the network with them and thus they should
be willing to pay a higher price. It encourages participation because
the value must increase at a rate higher than the COST for it to be
worth holding.

The DAO separates governance tokens from dividend tokens. Dividend
tokens are minted at a constant rate and distributed to the DAO
treasury, the workers the DAO hires, and the governance token
holders. Income from the product are distributed proportionally to
dividend token holders.

When new governance tokens are minted some portion are distributed to
workers and users where the rest are auctioned subject COST.
