Start with standard processes and trust them long enough to improve
them with the benefit of hindsight.

Clearly processes benefit from being well suited to their specific
context, and one that is custom designed will be more effective but be
aware of and avoid the common problem of confusing inexperience for a
poor fit.

The value of a process is in the reduction of explicit communication
and negotiation needed for everyone involved to do the right work at
the right time without wasted effort. The value of a process is in the
ability of collaborators to anticipate what each other needs and will
do.

## Do the research

Start with an appropriate established industry standard practice.
Start by the book. You won't be able to see the emergent properties of
the processes you may try to design by intuition or imagination.

## Practice it

Practitioners don't see how a process works for them until they are
good at it. Only once it's a habit and everyone involved can
confidently anticipate their collaborators needs and actions to does
the value of the process arise.

## Explicit goals and monitoring

There is a dilemma here. We humans can be resistant to change once
we've gotten used to something, but can't tell how well a process will
work for us until we are used to it. We need something to show us
what's happening and how well it's working in explicit objective
terms.

Decide what you want out of the process, find ways to measure how well
it's working, and build those into what you are doing. Many good
processes you might find when doing the research will include this.
Scrum includes monitoring velocity for instance.

## The benefit of hindsight

Start to make changes when you have the benefit of hindsight. If you
are monitoring the process you'll be able to see the benefits of
mastering it's execution as the team gains that mastery. At some point
those improvements will slow down or stop and that's a good indicator
that you have enough experience with it to know how it's working and
start to make improvements specific to your individual context.
