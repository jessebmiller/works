Given a set of established ideas, new contributions can be given an
origionality score by decentralized oracle.

A network of uncoordinated reviewers each stake some amount of value
on and commit to specific answers to two questions. All stakes go into
a reward pool along with possibly some other source of value (like
some newly minted token for example)

* What currently established idea that influenced this new idea?
* How closely (0-1) does this new idea resemble that previous idea?

After some pre-established time period the answers are revealed and
compiled.  Answers to the first question are tallied and sorted by
number of occurances. Those who responded within some percentile of
the most common response share some portion of the reward pool. In
addition, for each response within that percentile, respondants within
one standard deviation from the median answer to the second question
share the remaining portion of the reward pool.

A truely novel idea may not attract participation because individuals
may not be confident they can coordinate on an influencing idea.
- This is mitigated if "(None, 0)" is a valid response giving the
  community an answer to coordinate on in cases of novelty

A complete copy idea may not attract participation because people
won't believe that there will be a range of responses.
- This is mitigated if the contributor of the idea is required to
  stake some value that goes into the reward pool if it does not meet
  some threshold of originality

The median resemblance ratings of responses within the percentile
could be used by a network to automatically share any value flowing to
the contribution with it's influencing ideas.
